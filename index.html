			<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
			<p>I am currently working as a freelance graphic designer, stylist, and photographer in New York.  Over the course of my seven year career I have had the pleasure to work with clients from Sanrio to Le Labo creating everything from packaging and product to in-store display.  I spent five years of my career in Tokyo, Japan where I enjoyed working with in-house design teams for a major Japanese retail and restaurant corporation called LS Group.  While in Tokyo I launched the accessory brand Le Vero under this parent company in 2010.</p>

			<p>I am currently expanding my skills to include front end web development through an awesome course at General Assembly in New York.  I’m so excited to apply my passion and personal asthetic to this new medium to create engaging user experiences.  Please contact me so we can talk about all of the gorgeous work we can do together!</p>
